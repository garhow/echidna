# Echidna

Echidna is an experimental engine for a three-dimensional classic Sonic game.

This engine's movement is based on the outstanding physics information found in the [Sonic Retro Physics Guide](http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide).

This project was inspired by the [Sonic Utopia](https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/sonic-utopia-early-demo.33/) fangame by Great Lange.
